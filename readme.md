# Distributed Texas Hold'Em

This is a peer-to-peer implementation of Texas Hold'Em poker:  
developed as an academic project for "Distributed systems" course, it could be used as skeleton for a major project, such as a smartphone version using bluetooth protocol.  

Game rules are simplified: there is not pot split and there is not possible join if session is already started.   
In addition, there is a "absolute" score surrounding the "coins" concept.  

#### Briefly:
a master node accepts subscriptions to game from other (initial slave) peers, then it becomes a peer node as other ones.   
Behind the scenes, the application uses a token ring implementation for peers turn, and an "oracle"/pre-emptive finite states machine for future peers behaviours ("correct"=the node is still in the game, or "wrong"=the node has crashed).  
Optimized service mechanisms (using parallelism and lambda/functional paradigm from Java8) help the "oracle" to handle crash happening and recovering - network communications are based on classic Java RMI, of course.

To run in demo mode in same host (with multiple address on same nic):  
	`sudo demo/set_ips`
	`demo/run IP`
which IP is one of the ip address added from the first script.

For example:

1. "sudo demo/set_ips;": set the virtual ips on eth0 - you could change as you prefer
2. "demo/run_dev 10.0.0.1": run the server/master for subscriptions - check to act as initializer and click "Accept registration"
3. "demo/run_dev 10.0.0.2": run the client/slave - insert the address of registrar (10.0.0.1) host and click "Register"
4. if you want you could other clients (the game accept a max of 8 total players, so you cold start up to 6 more clients)
5. click "close registrations and start game" on master/server gui to start the game
